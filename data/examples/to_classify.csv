"Rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, is a key therapeutic in the 
treatment of B cell lymphomas and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Global rates of 
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and RA are 
increasing, with a concomitant rise in individual and overall treatment costs. 
As such, biosimilar development may help facilitate greater access to treatment. 
The rituximab biosimilar CT-P10 (Truxima®) has recently received approval in 
Europe and South Korea for all indications held by reference rituximab (RTX). 
Areas covered: Here, the unmet needs and current market in the treatment of NHL, 
CLL and RA are outlined, followed by a comprehensive examination of the 
analytical, pre-clinical and clinical data demonstrating the equivalence and 
similarity of CT-P10 to RTX including with respect to pharmacokinetics, 
efficacy, safety and immunogenicity. Expert commentary: The rising treatment 
costs of NHL, CLL and RA pose a challenge to constrained healthcare budgets 
worldwide. Biosimilars may provide an effective solution to this conundrum. 
CT-P10 is equivalent to RTX in terms of efficacy and pharmacokinetics, and has a 
similar safety and immunogenicity profile. Approved in all indications held by 
RTX, CT-P10 has the potential to reduce treatment costs and thereby increase 
patient access to rituximab therapy.",,D016454:Review,"Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of the rituximab biosimilar CT-P10.",28766389
"Background: Biosimilars are highly similar to the licensed biologic (""reference product""), with no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity, or potency between the two products.

Objective: This comparative 52-week clinical study evaluated the efficacy, safety, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of PF-05280586 (Ruxience™ [a rituximab biosimilar]) versus rituximab reference product sourced from the EU (MabThera®; rituximab-EU).

Patients and methods: Subjects with CD20-positive, low-tumor-burden follicular lymphoma (LTB-FL) and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1 were randomized (1:1) to PF-05280586 or rituximab-EU (375 mg/m2 intravenously [once weekly for 4 weeks at days 1, 8, 15, and 22]), stratified using the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index 2 classification. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) at week 26 (percentage of subjects achieving complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]). Therapeutic equivalence was concluded if the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference in ORR between groups was within the prespecified margin (± 16%). Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), CR rate, safety, immunogenicity, PK, and PD.

Results: A total of 394 subjects were randomized: PF-05280586 (n = 196) or rituximab-EU (n = 198). ORR at week 26 was 75.5% (PF-05280586) versus 70.7% (rituximab-EU), for a difference of 4.66%; 95% CI (- 4.16 to 13.47), which was entirely within the prespecified equivalence margin. Rates of CR were 29.3% (PF-05280586) versus 31.0% (rituximab-EU). Estimated 1-year PFS rates were 78.2% (95% CI 70.2-84.2) and 83.0% (95% CI 75.0-88.6) for PF-05280586 and rituximab-EU, respectively. Safety, immunogenicity, and mean serum concentrations were similar between groups.

Conclusions: The efficacy, safety, immunogenicity, PK, and PD of PF-05280586 and rituximab-EU were similar up to week 52 in subjects with previously untreated CD20-positive LTB-FL.",,'D016430:Clinical Trial; D016428:Journal Article',"A Randomized, Double-Blind, Efficacy and Safety Study of PF-05280586 (a Rituximab Biosimilar) Compared with Rituximab Reference Product (MabThera ®) in Subjects with Previously Untreated CD20-Positive, Low-Tumor-Burden Follicular Lymphoma (LTB-FL)",31820339
"AIMS: Rituximab is standard care in a number of lymphoma subtypes, including 
follicular lymphoma (FL), although many patients are resistant to rituximab, or 
develop resistance with repeated treatment, and a high proportion relapse. 
Obinutuzumab is a novel anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody with improved efficacy 
over rituximab. It is approved for previously untreated chronic lymphocytic 
leukaemia (CLL), and for use with bendamustine in patients with 
rituximab-relapsed/refractory FL.
METHODS: Using a previously described population pharmacokinetic (PK) model of 
obinutuzumab in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and CLL, we conducted an 
exposure-response analysis using data from 6 clinical trials in patients with 
CD20+ B-cell malignancies (CLL11, GADOLIN, GATHER, GAUDI, GAUGUIN and GAUSS) to 
describe the PK properties of obinutuzumab, identify covariates influencing 
exposure, and explore how exposure affects safety, efficacy and 
pharmacodynamics.
RESULTS: A 2-compartment model with linear and time-dependent clearance 
described obinutuzumab PK. Disease type and subtype, body weight, baseline 
tumour size, and sex had the largest effects on PK. Obinutuzumab exposure was 
not associated with occurrence or severity of adverse events, but higher 
exposure appeared to be associated with greater efficacy, particularly longer 
progression-free survival. However, in multivariate Cox regression analysis, 
progression-free survival benefit in the obinutuzumab plus bendamustine arm was 
independent of exposure.
CONCLUSION: The updated population PK model reported here accurately describes 
the PK of obinutuzumab patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and CLL. The selected 
obinutuzumab dosing regimen offers clinical benefit in a majority of 
rituximab-refractory FL patients treated with bendamustine, irrespective of 
variability in exposure, whilst minimising adverse events.

"BACKGROUND: Studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis have shown that the 
rituximab biosimilar CT-P10 (Celltrion, Incheon, South Korea) has equivalent 
efficacy and pharmacokinetics to rituximab. In this phase 3 study, we aimed to 
assess the non-inferior efficacy and pharmacokinetic equivalence of CT-P10 
compared with rituximab, when used in combination with cyclophosphamide, 
vincristine, and prednisone (CVP) in patients with newly diagnosed 
advanced-stage follicular lymphoma.
METHODS: In this ongoing, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, 
active-controlled study, patients aged 18 years or older with Ann Arbor stage 
III-IV follicular lymphoma were assigned 1:1 to CVP plus intravenous infusions 
of 375 mg/m2 CT-P10 or rituximab on day 1 of eight 21-day cycles. Randomisation 
was done by the investigators using an interactive web or voice response system 
and a computer-generated randomisation schedule, prepared by a clinical research 
organisation. Randomisation was balanced using permuted blocks and was 
stratified by country, gender, and Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic 
Index score (0-2 vs 3-5). Study teams from the sponsor and clinical research 
organisation, investigators, and patients were masked to treatment assignment. 
The study was divided into two parts: part 1 assessing equivalence of 
pharmacokinetics (in the pharmacokinetics subset), and part 2 assessing efficacy 
in all randomised patients (patients from the pharmacokinetics subset plus 
additional patients enrolled in part 2). Equivalence of pharmacokinetics was 
shown if the 90% CIs for the geometric mean ratio of CT-P10 to rituximab in AUCτ 
and CmaxSS were within the bounds of the equivalence margin of 80% and 125%. 
Non-inferiority of response was shown if the one-sided 97·5% CI lay on the 
positive side of the -7% margin, using a one-sided test done at the 2·5% 
significance level. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients 
who had an overall response over eight cycles and was assessed in the efficacy 
population (all randomised patients). The primary pharmacokinetic endpoints were 
area under the serum concentration-time curve at steady state (AUCτ) and maximum 
serum concentration at steady state (CmaxSS) at cycle 4, assessed in the 
pharmokinetic population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, 
number NCT02162771.
FINDINGS: Between July 28, 2014, and Dec 29, 2015, 140 patients were enrolled. 
Here we report data for the eight-cycle induction period, up to week 24. The 
proportion of patients with an overall response in the efficacy population was 
64 (97·0%) of 66 patients in the CT-P10 treatment group and 63 (92·6%) of 68 
patients in the rituximab treatment group (4·3%; one-sided 97·5% CI -4·25), 
which lay on the positive side of the predefined non-inferiority margin. The 
ratio of geometric least squares means (CT-P10/rituximab) was 102·25% (90% CI 
94·05-111·17) for AUCτ and 100·67% (93·84-108·00) for CmaxSS, with all CIs 
within the bioequivalence margin of 80-125%. Treatment-emergent adverse events 
were reported for 58 (83%) of 70 patients in the CT-P10 treatment group and 56 
(80%) of 70 in the rituximab treatment group. The most common grade 3 or 4 
treatment-emergent adverse event in each treatment group was neutropenia (grade 
3, 15 [21%] of 70 patients in the CT-P10 group and seven [10%] of 70 patients in 
the rituximab group). The proportion of patients who experienced at least one 
treatment-emergent serious adverse event was 16 (23%) of 70 patients in the 
CT-P10 group and nine (13%) of 70 patients in the rituximab group.
INTERPRETATION: In this study, we show that CT-P10 exhibits non-inferior 
efficacy and pharmacokinetic equivalence to rituximab. The safety profile of 
CT-P10 was comparable to that of rituximab. CT-P10 might represent a new 
therapeutic option for advanced-stage follicular lymphoma.",,'D016430:Clinical Trial; D016428:Journal Article; D016449:Randomized Controlled Trial',"Efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and safety of the biosimilar CT-P10 compared with

"Rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody targeted against the pan-B-cell marker 
CD20, was the first monoclonal antibody to be approved for therapeutic use. 
Treatment with rituximab at standard weekly dosing is effective in more than 50% 
of patients with relapsed or refractory CD20-positive follicular non-Hodgkin's 
lymphoma, but is not curative. It is less effective in other subtypes of 
CD20-positive lymphoma and for retreatment, even with CD20 still expressed. 
Thus, binding of rituximab to CD20 is not sufficient to kill many lymphoma 
cells, indicating that there are mechanisms of resistance. Mechanisms of cell 
destruction that have been demonstrated to be activated by rituximab binding to 
CD20 include direct signaling of apoptosis, complement activation and 
cell-mediated cytotoxicity. The relative importance of each of these mechanisms 
in determining clinical response to rituximab treatment remains a matter of 
conjecture. Thus, the role of various resistance pathways, some documented in 
experimental systems and others still hypothetical, remains uncertain. 
Resistance could potentially be mediated by alterations in CD20 expression or 
signaling, elevated apoptotic threshold, modulation of complement activity or 
diminished cellular cytotoxicity. As the first of an expanding class of 
anticancer agents, lessons learned regarding the mechanism of rituximab action 
and resistance will be of increasing importance.",,D016454:Review,Rituximab (monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody): mechanisms of action and resistance.,14576843
